# Formity
#This is a work in progress and is not ready for use.
Formity builds forms using Bootstrap 3.3.4 

Basic concept is to have a class that can build commonly used forms quickly with the ability to add custom fields when needed.

Currently has Name and Address fields per-built and responsive ready.  Can add some custom tags.  Still needs other common tags like Radio and Check Boxes.

Would like to have it also validate forms after submission.
